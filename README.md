# Automatic Windshield Wiper 🚘🌧️

An embedded system project that automates **windshield wiper operation** based on **rainfall detection**.  
This system improves driver safety and convenience by activating the wipers automatically when rain is detected.  

---

## 🔹 Features
- 🌧️ **Rain Detection** – Sensors detect water droplets/rainfall on windshield  
- ⚡ **Automatic Wiper Activation** – DC motor starts/stops wiper based on rain intensity  
- 🎚️ **Variable Speed Control** – Adjusts wiper speed according to rainfall amount  
- 🔋 **Energy Efficient** – Operates only when required  

---

## 🔹 Hardware Components
- Arduino UNO / Microcontroller  
- Rain Sensor Module  
- L293D Motor Driver  
- DC Motor (for wiper movement)  
- Power Supply (Battery)  

---

## 🔹 Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE (Embedded C/C++)  
- Serial Monitor (for debugging)  

---

## 🔹 Working Principle
1. The **rain sensor module** detects water droplets.  
2. Sensor output is processed by **Arduino UNO**.  
3. The **motor driver (L293D)** activates the DC motor, moving the wiper blades.  
4. Wiper speed varies depending on rainfall intensity.

## 🔹 Applications
- Automobile industry (cars, buses, trucks)  
- Smart vehicles & automation systems  
- Prototype for advanced driver-assist systems  

---

## 🔹 Future Enhancements
- Integrate with IoT for remote monitoring  
- Add manual override + touch controls  
- Use AI to predict weather-based wiper control
